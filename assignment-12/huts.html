                    Almost all huts offer a great variety of delicious food.
                    Dishes vary from classic local specialities such as Kaiserschmarrn
                    or Currywurst to international classics such as burgers
                    and pasta. Don't forget to order a large beer with your food.
                    The beer on tap in Germany and Austria is considered to be 
                    the best in the world. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Food and drinks on lifestyle huts can be very expensive.
                    Considering the views and the atmosphere, it is fairly priced.
                    Plan on spending around $20 to $25 for lunch.

                Watch out for special events on the huts in your ski resort.
                Almost every day DJ's are playing all ski day long. DJ's play
                everything from house, electro, lounge to flashbacks and classics.

                <p class="paragraph">
                The Kristallhuette in Tyrol, Austria is considered to be one of the
                top addresses for parties on huts. Almost every day people are 
                dancing on the tables and having the time of their life.

                Some huts are located on the very top of high mountains. From the sky terrace,
                you can enjoy a fantastic look over valleys and mountains. Don't forget
                to take a snapchat for your story.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Don't forget to bring suncreen and sunglasses. In altitudes of 10,000ft and higher the sun
                    is very strong. Although drinks are expensive, it is important to hydrate
                    while resting or partying on huts. After a long day of skiing, you don't want
                    your muscles to tighten up.
