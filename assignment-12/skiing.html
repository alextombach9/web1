                    Do not miss out on Jumps. Sometimes it does
look scary but it is actually super fun. Just pay
attention to a few details so your ski day does not 
end in the hospital. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
1. Make sure to lean forward when you jump.
Don‘t get caught up in a suspine position, you‘ll
most likely not be able to land the jump.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
2. Try to find the perfect speed when you approach
a jump. If you go to fast, it‘ll be harder to land.
If you go to slow, you will land on a flat surface. This
will hurt both your knees and back.

                        Short Radius Skiing
                    </h2>
                    <p id="left" class="paragraph">
                    In order to be a master of short radii, a lot
of practice is necessary. To get of a good start,
make sure to have your edges in good condition
and if possible, rent out slalom skis.
                    </p>

                    <p id="left" class="paragraph">
1. The most important thing is that your upper
body stays calm and simply follows the up and 
down movement. Once you are in the fall-line,
put weight onto your outside ski and drag the edge
into the snow. You‘ll automatically begin the drive.
                    </p>
                    <p id="left" class="paragraph">
2. Once you made the curve, take the weight of
your outside foot and lift your upper body slightly.
The skis automatically go back into the fall-line.
Then, put weight on the other leg, which is now
your outside ski, to curve the other way.
                    </p>
                    <p id="left" class="paragraph">
3. Make sure you get a good rythm and enjoy
the most complicated form of skiing - the slalom!

                       Long Radius Skiing
                   </h2>
                   <p id="right" class="paragraph">
                   Skiing in long radii is my favorite style of skiing.
Once you master this style, you‘ll be able to lean
into curves at over 50 mph!
                    </p>
                    <p id="right" class="paragraph">
1. Skiing in long radii is comparable to a giant
slalom. Giant Slalom skis are best for this. I‘d
recommend a ski radius of apprx. 18m.
                    </p>
                    <p id="right" class="paragraph">
2. The basic concept is the same like when you
go in short radii. The difference is that you‘ll
stay longer on the edge of the ski to accelerate
within the curve.
                    </p>
                    <p id="right" class="paragraph">

3. Make sure to have your body weight ALWAYS
on the outside ski. Otherwise you‘ll fall when ski
over an ice plate.
