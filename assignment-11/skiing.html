                    Do not miss out on Jumps. Sometimes it does
look scary but it is actually super fun. Just pay
attention to a few details so your ski day doesn‘t 
end in the hospital. 

1. Make sure to lean forward when you jump.
Don‘t get caught up in a suspine position, you‘ll
most likely not be able to land the jump.

2. Try to find the perfect speed when you approach
a jump. If you go to fast, it‘ll be harder to land.
If you go to slow, you will land on a flat surface. This
will hurt both your knees and back.
